# SurgeBrawl-Translations
Translating strings from SurgeBrawl to other languages


### You can help us translate the server strings by making a pull request with your own translation.
# Important note.
You need to mark your translation with the language code (ru-RU, en-US)

## Where can I get the language code?
Server supports **ISO 639-1** format.<br>
You can find codes on [this page (CLICK HERE)](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)<br>
### If your language has two main language codes, just write about it in your pull request
