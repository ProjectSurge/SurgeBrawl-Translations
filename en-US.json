    "InterestingFact": "Did you know? The world's first programmer was a woman, the English woman Ada Lovelace. In the middle of the 19th century, she designed a plan of operations for the prototype of the modern computer, Charles Bebbidge's analytical machine, which could be used to solve Bernoulli's equation expressing the law of conservation of energy of a moving fluid. Ada passed away at the age of 37 before Bebbidge's machine could be built."
